This is a static webpage designed to showcase housing rental information. It's built using only HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easily accessible. The website features a responsive design, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes thanks to Flexbox.

# About me: 
I embarked on my coding journey through the Victoria Digital Job Program, where I had the opportunity to delve into the world of technology. This experience led me to enroll in a 16-week Web Development training program offered by General Assembly. It was a great learning experience. During this intensive course, I developed a few static websites.  Each step of these projects has been a valuable learning experience, and I'm eager to continue growing as a developer.
